    <h2>Overview of the Cessna150E</h2>
    <p>
        The Cessna 150 is a high-wing two seater aircraft that served as a trainer for many students.
        In particular, the Cessna 150 model E was produced as the variant for the 1965 model year.
        Among the Cessna 150E's unique features are the large window in the rear, straight tail and manual flaps;
        the rudder on the straight tail was actually more effective than newer versions of the Cessna 150 and is
        more effective when it comes to spin training.  The manual flaps have a 40 degree setting which means you
        can land on a dime.
